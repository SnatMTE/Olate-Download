The OD3 documentation is now written in XML so we can use our own tools
to generate different formats such as PDF, HTML and CHM. The documentation
source is xml/user-manual.xml which can be used to generate the human readable
documentation.

We use a tool called Aurigadoc and can be found at http://aurigadoc.sourceforge.net/

You can find the very latest automatically generated documentation at
